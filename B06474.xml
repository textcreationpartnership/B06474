            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The only Maxim in Chriſtianity!</l>
               <l>Mow <hi>England</hi> do I ſee thy ſtarrs ſhine clear,</l>
               <l>For though thy Natives hearts no Foe did fear</l>
               <l>I'th height of War: but for their Countries good</l>
               <l>Wool'd Right its wrong, or ſpend their deareſt blood,</l>
               <l>Rather than yeild, and as deaths welcome prize</l>
               <l>Render their lives a valerous ſacrifice:</l>
               <l>Like thoſe bold <hi>Turks</hi> who on their nimble feet</l>
               <l>Did run to face death with their winding ſheet;</l>
               <l>Yet notwithſtanding, all that's wiſe will deem</l>

               <l>Of peace and plenty, which the bleſſed hand</l>
               <l>Of a good King gave this diſtremper'd Land.</l>
               <l>A general joy this general peace atends,</l>
               <l>A happy vertue that makes Foes prove friends!</l>
               <l>What to our Citties good can be more dear,</l>
               <l>The Seas are free, each Ship doth paſs by clear,</l>

               <l>At which they ſmile, like dying Saints thar know</l>
               <l>They are to leave the earth and t' heaven goe,</l>
               <l>Indeed who is not glad, whoſe intereſt.</l>
               <l>Is not hereby made greater, whoſe is beſt,</l>
               <l>Is indiſputable, but all will confeſs</l>
               <l>Peace makes a univerſal happineſs.</l>
               <l>What ſhall I ſay? my weak Muſe can't impart</l>
               <l>Peculiar joyes, which every loyal heart</l>
               <l>Ecchoed, when proclamation of a Peace,</l>
               <l>Gave us aſſurance that our warrs muſt ceaſe:</l>
               <l>But if loud ſhouts and hollowing deſcry,</l>
               <l>A joyful heart, I am ſure I do not lye</l>

               <l>Torneys, Maſques, Theaters, will now become</l>
               <l>Our Halcyon days: what though the Heathen drum:</l>
               <l>Bellow for freedome and revenge, the noiſe</l>
               <l>Concerns not us, nor ſhall divert our joyes,</l>
               <l>Mor ſhall the thunder of their <hi>Corabins</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Drown the ſweet aires of our tun'd <hi>Violins;</hi>
               </l>

               <l>Gain'd them a calm ſecurity like ours.</l>
               <l>They'd hang their armes upon the Olive bough,</l>
               <l>And dance and revel then, as we may now.</l>
               <l>But let not our mirth extend to ſin,</l>
               <l>Leaſt peace abus'd create a war agi'n,</l>
               <l>Pardon my Muſe if that he ſeems to be</l>

               <l>In repreſenting to each Chriſtians view,</l>
               <l>Intire Emblems, from which may enſue</l>

               </l>
               <l>Though we've a peace, we muſt not now forget,</l>
               <l>We have been ſinful, but from ſin regret.</l>
               <l>Retire then preſumptuous man and ſee</l>

               <l>Diſpiſe the world, and what's voluptous,</l>
               <l>A perfect <hi>Dives</hi> to a <hi>Lazarus!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Truſt, truſt in God alone and he will be,</l>
               <l>Thy cheifeſt comfort in thy miſery,</l>
               <l>For when diſpair had almoſt wrought our death</l>
               <l>This welcome peace gave as a ſecond breath:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>England</hi> doubt not, thou haſt a God above.</l>
               <l>That will repleniſh thy wants with his love.</l>
               <l>Contemn the help that this world does afford,</l>
